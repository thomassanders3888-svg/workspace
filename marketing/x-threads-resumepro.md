## THREAD 1: "The ATS Black Hole"
**Best time to post:** Monday 9am EST (job seekers active)

**Tweet 1/6:**
75% of resumes never reach human eyes.

Not because you're unqualified.
Because the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) rejected you.

Here's the science of getting past the robots 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/6:**
Most people design resumes for humans.

But the first "person" reading your resume is software.

It scans, parses, and scores your resume in 3 seconds.

If it can't read your formatting? INSTANT REJECT.

Here's what breaks ATS systems:

---

**Tweet 3/6:**
❌ Multi-column layouts (ATS reads left-to-right, line by line)
❌ Headers/footers (content gets stripped)
❌ Tables (many ATS can't parse them)
❌ Fancy fonts (non-standard = unreadable)
❌ Graphics/logos (ignored or corrupted)

99% of "creative" resume templates fail ATS.

---

**Tweet 4/6:**
The solution?

Single-column. Standard fonts. Clear section headers.
Keywords from the job description. Measurable achievements.

That's it. Simple. Boring. And it WORKS.

We built ResumePro with 95%+ ATS compatibility scores.

50,000+ people used these to get interviews.

---

**Tweet 6/6:**
Your resume is too important to DIY.

One job offer = $50,000-$150,000+ over applying to 100 with a broken resume.

## THREAD 2: "Why I Charged $5"
**Best time to post:** Tuesday 11am EST

**Tweet 1/5:**
Why do ResumePro templates cost $5?

Most resume services charge $50-$300.
Templates elsewhere? $15-$40.

We priced at $5. Here's why 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/5:**
First, we're not here to get rich off templates.

$5 covers:
- Platform fees
- Basic support
- Iteration costs

It's sustainable. Not exploitative.

Job seekers are already stressed about money.
Adding expensive resume costs feels wrong.

---

**Tweet 3/5:**
Second, the real value is outcomes.

95% ATS scores are worth thousands in job opportunities.

A $5 template that gets you interviews at FAANG?
ROI is literally infinite.

Compare to resume writers charging $500+ with no ATS guarantee.

---

**Tweet 4/5:**
Included for $5:
✓ 7 different template styles
✓ Lifetime updates
✓ ATS scoring guide
✓ Industry-specific tips
✓ Google Docs + Word + PDF formats

Plus one template is FREE.
Try it. See the quality. Then decide on premium.

## THREAD 3: "Resume Keywords 2026"
**Best time to post:** Thursday 3pm EST

**Tweet 1/7:**
Keyword stuffing is dead.

But keyword IGNORANCE? That's killing resumes.

Here's how to match your resume to the job description (without sounding robotic) 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/7:**
The new ATS in 2026:

- Semantic matching (knows "Python" = "Python 3")
- Context understanding (not just buzzwords)
- Skills taxonomy (grouped competencies)
- Density scoring (balance, not stuffing)

Old tricks don't work. Authentic matching does.

---

**Tweet 3/7:**
The 3-layer keyword strategy:

LAYER 1: Job title synonyms
"Project Manager" = "PM" = "Program Manager" = "Project Lead"

LAYER 2: Core skills as written
If the JD says "React.js," write "React.js" not "JavaScript framework"

LAYER 3: Soft skills with metrics
"Led team" → "Led 5-person team" + result

---

**Tweet 4/7:**
Where to put keywords naturally:

✓ Summary (2-3 core competencies)
✓ Skills section (keyword list)
✓ Experience bullets (context + results)
✓ Education/certifications (relevant coursework)

Avoid: A separate "keywords" section at the bottom.
ATS flags this as manipulation.

---

**Tweet 5/7:**
Example transformation:

❌ BAD:
"Responsible for project management and team coordination"

✅ GOOD:
"Managed $2M software project using Agile methodology, delivering 15% under budget and 2 weeks early"

Keywords: Managed, Agile, software
Proof: Metrics show actual impact

---

**Tweet 6/7:**
ResumePro templates include:

- Keyword optimization checklist per template
- Industry-specific competency lists
- Before/after examples
- ATS scoring that checks keyword density

All for $5 (or free for the Entry-Level template).

---

**Tweet 7/7:**
You have 7 seconds to pass the ATS.
Not 7 minutes. Not 7 hours.

Make your resume count.

## THREAD 4: "FAANG Resume Breakdown"
**Best time to post:** Weekend 10am EST

**Tweet 1/5:**
I reviewed 100 resumes from people who got FAANG interviews.

Every single one shared these 5 traits:

---

**Tweet 2/5:**
1. Single-column layout
All 100.
Why? ATS preference + recruiter scanning speed.
If it's hard to read quickly, they're done.

---

**Tweet 3/5:**
2. Metrics in every bullet

Not "improved system."
"Reduced load time by 40% (2.3s → 1.4s)"

Not "led team."
"Led 8-person cross-functional team, increasing sprint velocity 25%"

Quantify everything.

---

**Tweet 4/5:**
3. Clear skill taxonomy

Grouping:
- Languages
- Frameworks
- Tools
- Methodologies

Not random keyword soup. Organized expertise.

---

**Tweet 5/5:**
4. Project impact stories
5. Consistent formatting

## SINGLE TWEETS (Filler Content)

**Tweet A:**
75% of resumes are rejected by ATS before a human sees them.

Not because you're unqualified.
Because your formatting confused the parser.

**Tweet B:**
Resume tip:

Change your file name from "Resume.pdf" to "Jane_Doe_Product_Manager.pdf"

Small change. Huge impact.
