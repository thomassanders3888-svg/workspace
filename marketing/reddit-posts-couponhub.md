## 📋 POST TEMPLATES (Copy-Paste Ready)

### POST 1: Value-First Deal Sharing (r/Deals)
**Title:** "[Deal] Laptop Pro Max $779 (40% off) - verified working"

**Body:**
Found this over at CouponHub. They're a newer deal aggregator that actually tests their codes.

**The deal:**
- Laptop Pro Max: $779 (was $1,299)
- Code: TECH40
- Verified working as of [current time]

**Why I'm sharing:**
Most coupon sites are full of expired codes. These guys update hourly and test everything before posting. No affiliate spam, just actual deals.

Site: couponhubhq.com

Disclaimer: They do use affiliate links (like most deal sites), but the deals are legit and verified.

### POST 2: Educational (r/personalfinance)
**Title:** "YSK: You can save 20-40% on tech by using verified deal aggregators instead of just Amazon"

**Body:**
**Why YSK:** Most people check one site (Amazon) and call it done. But the real deals happen through:

1. **Manufacturer refurbished** (Apple, Dell, Lenovo direct)
2. **Stackable codes** (coupon + cashback + sale)
3. **Flash sale aggregators** (verified hourly instead of weekly)

**The numbers:**
I built CouponHub (bias warning) after realizing most deal sites just scrape expired codes for SEO. We started testing every code manually instead.

Average user saves: $127/tech item
Time to find deal: 60 seconds vs. 20 minutes searching

**How to verify deals:**
- Check if codes are tested (not just listed)
- Look for hourly updates (not monthly)
- Stack with Rakuten/Capital One for extra 5-10%

**Examples:**
- Laptops: $1,299 → $779 (same model, 6 months later)
- Noise cancelling headphones: $199 → $139 (current gen)
- Smart plugs 4-pack: $60 → $29

**Sites I use:**
- CouponHub (my site - verified hourly)
- Slickdeals (crowdsourced, hit or miss)
- Rakuten (cashback, not deals themselves)

**TL;DR:** Don't just Amazon. Deals exist if you know where to look.

### POST 3: Community AMA (r/buildapcsales)
**Title:** "I built a deal aggregator that tests codes before posting. AMA about finding PC/component deals."

**Body:**
Hey r/buildapcsales,

I got frustrated with expired coupon codes, so I built CouponHub to test every code before posting. We're small (launched recently) but verification is our whole thing.

**What we do differently:**
- Hourly updates (deals expire fast)
- Manual code testing (95%+ work rate)
- No fake "80% off" clickbait
- Focus on tech - especially PC components

**Some current deals:**
- Laptops: 25-40% off
- Monitors: 20-30% off  
- Peripherals: 30-50% off
- Storage/SSDs: rotating deals

**AMA about:**
- Deal cycles (when to buy)
- Best sources for PC deals
- How to stack discounts
- Deal verification process

Site: couponhubhq.com (yes, affiliate links - but verified first)

Fire away with questions. Happy to share what I've learned.

### POST 4: List Post (r/frugal)
**Title:** "10 ways to save on tech in 2026 (from someone who analyzes deal patterns)"

**Body:**
I've been tracking tech deal patterns for a year. Here are the actual strategies that work:

1. **Buy 6-12 months after release**
   - Launch prices are inflated
   - 6 months: 15% off typical
   - 12 months: 30-40% off (same product)

2. **Check manufacturer refurbished**
   - Apple, Dell, Lenovo direct
   - Same warranty, 20-30% cheaper
   - Often just open-box returns

3. **Stack deals**
   - Sale price
   + Coupon code
   + Cashback (Rakuten, etc.)
   + Rewards credit card
   = Total savings 40-50%

4. **Use verified aggregators**
   - Most coupon sites are SEO farms with expired codes
   - Look for hourly updates, manual testing
   - We do this at CouponHub, but there are others

5. **Time your purchase**
   - Black Friday: good for TVs, bad for laptops
   - Back-to-school: laptop deals
   - January: fitness tech
   - March: spring cleaning sales

6. **Join deal communities**
   - r/buildapcsales (for PC stuff)
   - r/LaptopDeals (mobile)
   - r/Deals (general)
   - r/frugal (philosophy)

7. **Price tracking**
   - CamelCamelCamel (Amazon history)
   - Keepa extension
   - Don't trust "was" prices - verify actual history

8. **Student/military discounts**
   - Often stackable with coupons
   - 10% minimum, sometimes 20%

9. **Credit card perks**
   - Price protection (some cards)
   - Extended warranties
   - Purchase protection

10. **Buy previous generation**
    - iPhone 15 vs 16 (minimal real difference)
    - Ryzen 7000 vs 9000 series
    - Save 30-40% for 90% of performance

**What I built:**
CouponHub tests codes hourly and verifies before posting. Free to use.
