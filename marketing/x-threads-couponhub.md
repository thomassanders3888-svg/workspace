## THREAD 1: "The Psychology of Saving"
**Best time to post:** Tuesday 10am EST or Thursday 2pm EST

**Tweet 1/5:**
I analyzed 10,000+ purchases and found something wild:

The average person overpays by 27% on tech products.

Not because they're bad at negotiating.
Because they don't know WHERE to look.

Here's the psychology of smart deal-finding 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/5:**
Most people check ONE site before buying.

Amazon. Best Buy. Done.

But the real deals live in a different ecosystem:
- Direct manufacturer sales
- Refurbished channels
- Affiliate flash sales
- Stackable coupon codes

We built @CouponHubHQ to aggregate them.

---

**Tweet 3/5:**
The "laptop deal" you saw on Amazon?
It's often just their "normal" price dressed up.

Real deals:
✓ 40% off MSRP (not inflated "retail")
✓ Stackable: coupon + cashback + sale
✓ Time-limited: hours, not weeks
✓ Verified: codes actually work at checkout

---

**Tweet 4/5:**
Our users save an average of $127 per tech purchase.

One guy bought a $1,299 laptop for $779.
That's $520 in 60 seconds of browsing.

Time is money. Your time is worth more.

But so is your money. Most people waste both.

## THREAD 2: "The 40% Rule"
**Best time to post:** Weekend morning 9am EST

**Tweet 1/6:**
The 40% Rule:

If you're paying retail price for tech in 2026,
you're donating money to companies that don't need it.

Here's how to stop 👇

---

**Tweet 2/6:**
Every tech product goes through price cycles:

Launch: Full price (early adopters pay)
3 months: 15% off (waited a bit)
6 months: 30% off (sweet spot)
12 months: 40%+ off (same product, half price)

The trick is knowing WHERE the 40% deals are.

---

**Tweet 3/6:**
We built @CouponHubHQ to solve exactly this.

Curated deals from:
- Refurb channels (Apple, Dell, etc.)

Real deal from today:

Laptop Pro Max: $1,299 → $779 (-40%)
Noise Cancelling Buds: $199 → $139 (-30%)
Smart Plug 4-Pack: $60 → $29 (-50%)

Codes verified. Links tested.
You'd never find these browsing normally.

---

**Tweet 5/6:**
The math on this:

If you buy 3-4 tech items per year,
CouponHub saves you $300-500 annually.

That's a monthly car payment.
Or a nice dinner out every month.
Just for checking one extra site.

## THREAD 3: "Why Coupon Sites Fail"
**Best time to post:** Wednesday evening 7pm EST

**Tweet 1/5:**
99% of coupon websites are garbage.

Here's why:

95% of codes are expired.
Sites scrape and repost old deals.
You waste 10 minutes trying codes that don't work.

We fixed this. Here's how 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/5:**
The coupon industry dirty secret:

Most "deals" sites are SEO farms.
They don't care if codes work.
They just want you to click affiliate links.

Meanwhile, you get frustrated at checkout.
Time wasted. Trust broken.

---

**Tweet 3/5:**
We built @CouponHubHQ differently:

✓ Every code tested manually before posting
✓ Hourly updates (deals expire fast)
✓ Only verified, working discounts
✓ No fake "80% off" clickbait
✓ 95%+ code success rate

If it's on CouponHub, it works. Period.

---

**Tweet 4/5:**
The result?

Average user saves $127 per tech purchase.
Average user visits 3x per week.
Average user refers 2 friends.

Because when you actually SAVE people money,
they tell everyone.

Word of mouth > paid ads every time.

**Tweet B:**
The average person overpays by $300+ on tech annually.

Not because they're bad with money.
Because they don't know where the real deals live.
