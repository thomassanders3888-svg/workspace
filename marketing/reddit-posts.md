## Post 1: r/SideProject — Portfolio Showcase

**Title:** Built 20+ websites in 3 months (~2-4 hours each). Here's what I learned.

**Body:**

I'm a Navy nuclear instructor by day, indie maker on weekends.

Wanted to test if I could build and ship fast without spending money. Challenge accepted: build useful sites in single HTML files, deploy to GitHub Pages (free).

**What I built:**

**AI & Tools (4 sites)**
- AI Tools Directory — curated list of 100+ tools (affiliate links)
- Prompt Vault — 500+ AI prompts by category
- AI Video Tools — comparison of video generators
- Idea Finder — match business ideas to tools

**Career Resources (8 sites)**
- Resume Templates — ATS-optimized designs, $5 each
- Salary Negotiator — Remote salary calculator
- NukeJobs — Nuclear career + salary calculator for Navy nukes
- Job boards for AI, indie work, prompt engineering
- ClearPath — Military transition resources

**Creator & Business (6 sites)**
- CreatorStack — Tools for YouTubers, podcasters, writers
- SaaS LTD Tracker — Lifetime deal aggregator
- CouponHub — SaaS discounts
- Notion vs Obsidian — Tool comparison

**Other (2 sites)**
- Nuclear Energy Movement — Advocacy site
- Birth Rate Visualizer — Data visualization

**Costs so far:**
- Hosting: $0 (GitHub Pages)
- Domains: $0 (haven't bought any — sites live on thomassanders3888-svg.github.io/[site-name])
- Total spent: $0

**Revenue so far:**
- Affiliate clicks: $149
- Direct sales: $0 (payment processing delayed)
- Ads: $0 (AdSense rejected subdomains)

**What worked:**
- Single-page HTML ships fast
- GitHub Pages is instant & free
- Building multiple niches lets you compare which gets traction

**What didn't:**
- AdSense doesn't like subdomain sites (need custom domains)
- Should have added email capture day 1
- Spent too long on design vs shipping

**Best ROI:**
- Affiliate links on high-intent pages
- Tools that solve a specific pain point (NukeJobs targets 5,000 Navy nukes graduating annually)

## Post 3: r/Navy — Nuke Transition Resource

**Title:** Built a salary calculator for Navy Nukes transitioning civilian — looking for feedback

**Body:**

Reactor operator here. Watch too many sailors stress about civilian transition not knowing what their skills are worth.

Built a simple calculator that estimates civilian nuclear salary based on:
- Pay grade (E-3 to O-5)
- Security clearance level
- SRO license status
- Location (+$15K for hot markets)

Also adding job listings (utility companies, research labs, etc.)

**Current range from the calc:**
- E-5 with TS + SRO: $90K–$110K
- O-3 with all bonuses: $120K–$145K

Link: https://thomassanders3888-svg.github.io/nukejobs

**What I'm working on next:**
- Specific employer profiles (Duke, Exelon, TVA, etc.)
- Security clearance crossover guidance
- Resume tips for reactor operators

Any other features you'd want? Specifically looking for:
1. Do the salary ranges match your experience?
2. What companies should I add?
3. Any transition guides missing from the web?

Appreciate the feedback.

## Post 4: r/cscareerquestions — ATS Resume Tips

**Title:** I reviewed 200+ resumes as a hiring manager. Here's why 90% failed ATS screening.

**Body:**

Not a recruiter. Navy nuclear instructor who occasionally reviews tech resumes for defense contractors. Here's what I learned:

**The invisible wall:**
Most companies >500 employees use ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems). These bots scan resumes before humans see them. They reject 70%+ before review.

**Why resumes get auto-rejected:**

1. **PDF with graphics/photos** — Parser can't read them
2. **Multi-column format** — Right column often ignored
3. **Headers/footers** — Text lost during parsing
4. **Creative fonts** — System fonts only
5. **Tables** — Content scrambled for parsers

**The safe format:**
- Single column
- Calibri/Arial/Times
- No graphics
- No header/footer
- Save as .docx (not PDF) for maximum compatibility

**What to include:**
- Skills section near top
- Keyword matching job description
- Clear job titles + dates

Built a template that passes common ATS filters: https://thomassanders3888-svg.github.io/resumes

**AMA about:**
- Security clearance hiring process
- Defense contractor resume expectations
- Military -> tech transition

## Post 5: r/SideHustle — AI Tool Monetization

**Title:** Made my first $149 online — here's how (with numbers)

**Body:**

**TL;DR:** Built a simple AI Tools Directory, added affiliate links, made first sales within 45 days of launch.

**Site:** AI Tools Directory
- Built: Single HTML file, ~2 hours
- Hosting: GitHub Pages ($0)
- Traffic: Mostly organic via Reddit posts
- Monetization: Amazon Associates + direct affiliate programs (Jasper, Copy.ai, etc.)

**The $149 breakdown:**
- Jasper AI signups: $87
- Copy.ai conversions: $42
- Amazon (book recommendations): $20
- Grand total: $149

**Time invested:**
- Build: 2 hours
- Content updates: ~30 min/week
- Promotion: ~2 hours/week (Reddit, Quora)

**What I learned:**
1. High-intent keywords beat volume. "Best AI writing tools" crushes "AI tools" 
2. Personal recommendations convert better than lists
3. Update dates matter — "Updated Feb 2026" increases CTR
4. Disclosure required — "Affiliate links" banner actually increases trust

**Next steps:**
- Buying custom domains ($27 total) to get AdSense approved
- Building email capture
- Creating comparison tables (they rank well)

**Lowest cost path for others:**
1. Pick a niche you know (job, hobby, skill)
2. Build single-page resource (directory, calculator, template)
3. Monetize with affiliates first (0 cost to start)
4. Scale what works, kill what doesn't

## Post 6: r/militaryfinance — Career Transition

**Title:** Built a salary estimator for Navy nuclear techs leaving service

**Body:**

Muclear side — wanted to share something built for my sailors.

When you separate, there's a gap between "I'm a qualified reactor operator" and "what does that pay in the real world?" 

Built a simple calculator:
https://thomassanders3888-svg.github.io/nukejobs

**Inputs:**
- Current pay grade
- Security clearance level
- SRO license (yes/no)
- Location preference

**Outputs:**
- Estimated civilian salary range
- Typical job titles
- Companies hiring for your level

**Sample results:**
- E-5 / TS / SRO: $90K–$110K
- E-7 / SCI / SRO: $115K–$140K
- O-3 / TS / no SRO: $110K–$130K

These are based on actual job postings from Exelon, Duke, TVA.

**What I'm adding:**
- Clearance crossover guide (TS to Q, etc.)
- Specific company profiles
- Interview tips for reactor operator roles

**Question for the community
