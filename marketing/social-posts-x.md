### 2. ResumePro - Pain Point Hook
**Length: 278 chars**

Spent 6 hours perfecting my resume.
Applied to 47 jobs.
Got ZERO callbacks.

Problem? ATS systems auto-rejected me before any human saw it.

Truth: Format matters more than content for first review.

I built ATS templates that actually pass filters:

Each one costs less than coffee ☕

**Length: 280 chars**

### 4. Portfolio Showcase Thread (5 posts)

**1/5** After 6 months of building in public, today I'm sharing 20+ sites I've shipped — what worked, what didn't, and what made $0 vs $149.

Thread 🧵

**2/5** First, what actually matters:
- Single-page HTML sites
- SEO-first content
- Clear monetization from day 1
- GitHub Pages hosting (free)

My cost to launch: $0
Time to deploy: 2-4 hours per site

**3/5** Revenue breakdown:
- Affiliate links: $149 total
- Direct sales: $0 (payment processing still pending)
- Ads: $0 (AdSense rejected GitHub subdomains)

Lesson: Free hosting has limitations.

**4/5** The sites themselves: https://thomassanders3888-svg.github.io/tcreations3888

Includes:
- AI tool directories (2)
- Job boards (5)
- Niche calculators (3)
- Games portfolio (1)
- Creator resources (6)

**5/5** My 3 biggest mistakes:
1. Didn't buy domains early ($27 total cost retrospect)
2. No email capture (building list now)
3. Waited too long for analytics/tracking

### 6. LinkedIn Cross-Post (Resume Focus)
**Length: 300 words, adjusted for LinkedIn**

I see a lot of talented people struggling to get callbacks.

Not because they're unqualified.
Because their resume never reaches human eyes.

Here's what 95% of applicants don't know:

Large companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to filter candidates before a recruiter even sees them. These systems:
- Can't parse fancy headers/footers
- Reject PDFs with graphics
- Fail on non-standard formats

If your resume has columns, icons, or creative fonts, you might be invisible.

I spent 5 years in Navy nuclear — a field that demands precision. I took that same rigor and built ATS-friendly resume templates.

Each template:
✅ Passes common ATS filters
✅ Uses recruiter-approved layouts
✅ Costs less than lunch ($5 or FREE)

The free "Entry-Level" template includes:
- Single-column layout for ATS compatibility
- Skills-first structure for career changers
- Clean formatting that parses cleanly

Just tools that work.
