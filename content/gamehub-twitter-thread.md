## Tweet 1/9 — The Hook

**Tired of checking 5 different apps just to find what game to play?**

I built GameHub — the unified game library that brings Steam, Epic, GOG, Xbox Game Pass & more into one beautiful home.

No more launcher juggling. Finally. 👇

## Tweet 2/9 — The Problem

Every gamer knows this pain:

• Steam library buried in 200+ games
• Epic freebies you forgot exist  
• Game Pass games scattered somewhere
• GOG classics collecting digital dust

Your games are everywhere. Your time shouldn't be.

---

## Tweet 3/9 — The Solution

GameHub connects to ALL your libraries automatically.

✅ Steam — synced
✅ Epic Games — synced  
✅ GOG Galaxy — synced
✅ Xbox Game Pass — synced
✅ itch.io — synced

One dashboard. Every game you own.

## Tweet 4/9 — Smart Features

It's not just a list. It's intelligent:

📊 Track playtime across ALL platforms
🎯 "Continue Playing" surfaces your current obsessions
🔍 Filter by: Installed | Backlog | 100% Complete
📦 See which games are DRM-free (portable!)

Your library, organized YOUR way.

## Tweet 5/9 — Pretty Actually Matters

Dark mode by default. Clean grid layout.
Game artwork front and center.

No bloat. No corporate "game store" upsells. 

Just you and your collection, looking like it deserves to.

## Tweet 6/9 — Cross-Platform

Windows? ✅
macOS? ✅  
Linux? ✅ (naturally)

Your library follows you. Import from anywhere, play everywhere.

(Respects your platform choice. No walled gardens.)

---

## Tweet 7/9 — Privacy First

• No account required to use
• Local-first: your data stays on YOUR machine
• Open source (GPL v3)
• Optional cloud sync if YOU want it

Your games, your data, your control.

---

## Tweet 8/9 — Free Forever

GameHub is free. Always will be.

No subscriptions. No ads. No "pro tier" locked features.

Built by gamers, for gamers.

If it saves you time and helps you rediscover great games, that's payment enough.
