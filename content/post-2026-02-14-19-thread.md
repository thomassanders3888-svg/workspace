## MAIN POST (280 chars max)

We've banned calculators in math, Wikipedia in research, and now ChatGPT in classrooms.

Spoiler: We lose every time.

The future belongs to humans who learn WITH AI, not those shielded from it.

What if we taught *augmented* thinking instead of pretending tools don't exist?

School districts are spending millions on "AI detection software" and drafting policies to ban ChatGPT.

They're making the same mistake we always make.

Thread on why prohibition fails—and what actually prepares kids for 2035.

Remember when teachers said "you won't always have a calculator"?

Turns out, we do. Always.

The average person carries 100,000x the computing power of Apollo 11 in their pocket.

And we use it. For everything.

**3/12**

Banning ChatGPT doesn't teach integrity.

It teaches avoidance.

It signals that the tool is dangerous instead of teaching *how* to use it. Like banning spell-check. Like banning search engines.

We're confusing "cheating" with "augmented capability."

**4/12**

The real question isn't "how do we stop students from using AI?"

It's "how do we redesign education so AI enhances learning instead of circumventing it?"

That's harder. It requires rethinking assessment, curriculum, and what "knowing" means.

**5/12**

Here's a wild idea:

What if essays became "show your work"—not the final output, but the reasoning chain?

What if students submitted prompts, iterations, and self-corrections alongside their AI-assisted analysis?

Transparency > Prohibition.

**6/12**

I work with technical professionals who operate complex systems.

The ones who thrive aren't the ones who memorized the most procedures.

They're the ones who can synthesize massive information, make judgment calls under uncertainty, and use every tool available.

That's what AI literacy looks like.

**7/12**

In the nuclear Navy, we drill until reaction becomes instinct.

But we ALSO provide checklists, simulators, and decision aids.

Because when the pressure's on, you want humans who know *when* to trust tools—and when to override them.

That's the skill. Tool discrimination.

**8/12**

Let's be honest about what we're really doing when we ban AI in schools:

We're preserving a system designed for the 1950s workforce.

Industrial-age schooling: memorize, regurgitate, repeat.

Knowledge-work economy: synthesize, critique, create.

See the disconnect?

**9/12**

The countries getting this right (Singapore, Estonia, parts of UAE) aren't reducing rigor.

They're redirecting it.

Less: "Write 5 paragraphs on the causes of WWI"
More: "Evaluate three AI-generated summaries of WWI causes. What's missing? What's biased?"

**10/12**

Future job interview, circa 2035:

"Tell me about a time you used AI to solve a problem you couldn't solve alone."

"How did you verify the output?"

"When did you reject the AI's suggestion?"

Students practicing this NOW have a decade head start.

**11/12**

I'm not saying this transition is easy.

Teachers are underpaid, under-resourced, and under constant "reform."

Adding "teach AI literacy" to their plate without support is unfair.

But banning the tool that's already in every student's pocket? That's not a solution. It's surrender.

**12/12**

The real curriculum shift:

From: "Do you know the answer?"
To: "Do you know how to find, verify, and apply the answer?"

That's symbiotic harmony—not replacement, but augmentation.

Adapt curriculum or become obsolete.
