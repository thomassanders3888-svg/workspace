# AI Tool Finder - Email Drip Campaign

## Email 1: Welcome

**Subject:** Welcome to AI Tool Finder — your first 3 recommendations inside 🚀

**Preview Text:** Here are 3 tools that might just change how you work.

### Email Body

Hey there,

Welcome to the AI Tool Finder community! I'm thrilled you decided to join thousands of others who are discovering how AI can actually make their lives easier (not more complicated).

The world of AI tools is exploding right now — new apps launch daily, and it's tough to know what's worth your time. That's exactly why I started this newsletter: to cut through the noise and surface tools that actually deliver.

To get you started, here are **3 AI tools** I'm genuinely excited about this month:

1. **Claude** — Think of it as your thoughtful research assistant. Great for writing, analysis, and complex problem-solving.
2. **Midjourney** — The gold standard for AI image generation. If you need visuals for presentations or content, this is it.
3. **Descript** — Edit audio and video by editing text. It's like magic for podcasters and video creators.

**Want the full list of my top 20 tools?** I've compiled them (with use cases) in a handy guide.

## Email 2: Discovery

**Subject:** How to actually find the right AI tool (without losing your mind)

**Preview Text:** A simple framework for choosing tools that fit your workflow.

### Email Body

Hi again,

Let's be honest — the AI tool space is overwhelming. Every other tweet promises a tool that will "10x your productivity," but how do you know what actually works for *you*?

Over the past year of testing hundreds of tools, I've developed a simple framework I call **"The 3-Fit Test."** Run any tool through these questions before committing:

**1. Problem Fit**
Does it solve a specific pain point you have *right now*? Not a hypothetical future problem — something that bugs you daily.

**2. Workflow Fit**
Does it slot into how you already work, or does it require you to rebuild your entire process? The best tools feel invisible.

**3. Learning Fit**
Be honest: will you actually learn it? A powerful tool that sits unused is worse than a simpler one you master.

**Pro tip:** Most people overestimate what they need. Start with one category (writing, image editing, research) and find your winner there before expanding.

Want me to recommend a tool based on your specific workflow? Just reply to this email — I read every response.

Happy hunting,

P.S. — Your replies help me improve recommendations for everyone. Don't be a stranger!
