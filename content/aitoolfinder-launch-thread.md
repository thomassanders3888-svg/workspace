# AI Tool Finder Launch Thread 🚀

## Tweet 1 - The Hook 🎣
I just shipped something I've been working on for weeks...

A curated directory of 20+ AI tools that actually solves a problem that's been driving me (and probably you) crazy.

## Tweet 2 - The Problem 😤
We've got a PROBLEM.

The AI tool space is exploding. Hundreds of new tools launch every week.

- Which one's actually good?
- Which one's worth the money?
- Which one does what I *actually* need?

I've spent HOURS researching, only to sign up for something that doesn't work. Sound familiar?

## Tweet 3 - The Solution 💡
So I built AI Tool Finder.

Simple premise: 
Curated directory + smart filters = no more endless searching.

Every tool is vetted. Categorized by use case. Filtered by pricing.

Find exactly what you need in under 60 seconds.

---

## Tweet 4 - Key Features ⚡
Here's what makes it different:

🔍 Smart search (finds by use case, not just name)
📂 Categories: Content, Design, Code, Productivity, Audio, Video, More
💰 Pricing filters: Free, Freemium, Paid
⭐ Curated only (no spam, no dead tools)

Built for people who value their time.

Quick question for you:

Drop it below—I might add it to the directory 👇

(Bonus: If I add it, I'll credit you!)

## Tweet 9 - Bonus Context 🎯
Why I'm building this:

I've tried 50+ AI tools this year. Most were meh. A few changed my workflow entirely.

The difference? Having someone who already filtered the noise.

That's what AI Tool Finder does for you.
