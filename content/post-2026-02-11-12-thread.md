In 2023, the US approved 1 new nuclear reactor. In 1960, we built 1 per month. 

We didn't forget how. We just decided winning elections was more important than building.

What happens when the AI we're racing to build needs 5x more power?

In 2023, the US approved exactly one new nuclear reactor.

In the 1960s, we averaged one per month.

We didn't forget how to build them. Steel didn't vanish. Concrete didn't disappear.

The only thing harder to find today is political will. 🧵

Know what's funny? We never stopped needing baseload power.

Every hospital, data center, and aluminum smelter still runs 24/7.

The "renewables-only" crowd keeps promising storage breakthroughs that
magic-84% of the time. Beautiful. But hospitals don't run on promises.

The nuclear industry has a PR problem and an NRC problem.

Same agency built for 4-reactor-a-year pace now takes 15 years for approvals.

Vogtle Units 3 & 4 came online in 2023-24. First new US reactors in 7 years. $31B, 7 years late.

That's not an engineering failure. That's regulatory capture.

Meanwhile, here's what they don't talk about:

* Nuclear: capacity factor ~93% (runs basically always)
* Solar: ~25% (clouds, night)
* Wind: ~35% (calm days)

This isn't anti-renewable. It's math.

20% of US electricity comes from 92 aging reactors. Average age: 42 years.

Industry folks know: the Navy runs hundreds of small reactors without incident.

Why? Because the military doesn't do NRC licensing dances for 15 years.

They have standards. Rigorous ones. But they also have urgency.

Build. Test. Deploy. Iterate.

Sound familiar, startup people?

Enter the SMR revolution (Small Modular Reactors).

NuScale, TerraPower, Kairos, X-energy.

Factory-built. Transportable. Scalable.

US has approved... one SMR design. NuScale. Took 6 years.

Canada approved their first SMR pathway in 2022.

We're not the leaders anymore. We're followers.

But here's the problem nobody's solving: **AI compute.

Data center energy demand is projected to triple by 2030. 

Training GPT-5? Estimated 5x the power of GPT-4.

You know what powers most AI training today? Coal and gas.

Surprised? Don't be.

Microsoft just signed deals for nuclear power for AI data centers. So did Google. So did Amazon.

They're not stupid. They see what's coming.

The companies building our AI future are quietly panicking about where the electrons will come from.

The gap between rhetoric and reality is hilarious.

So what's the fix?

1. **NRC reform**: 4-year approval caps. Not 14. Not 40.
2. **Standardized designs**: Pick 3. Mass produce. Stop reinventing.
3. **Regulatory reciprocity**: If Canada/Europe approves it, fast-track US review.
4. **Build workforce**: We have enough nuclear-trained sailors to start. Use them.

Bold? Yes. Impossible? No.

The alternative isn't prettier:

More gas plants. Longer permitting. Higher prices. Blackouts. 

Germany tried the "nuclear exit." Result: coal dependency, failed climate targets, dependence on Russian gas.

Japan restarted reactors after Fukushima (different design, different failure mode) because desperation beats dogma.

Here's my question to anyone planning to age another 40 years:

Do we want the power grid our grandparents built, or do we want to build one our grandchildren can trust?

Because the AI revolution, the electric vehicle transition, the industrial resurgence—none of it works without reliable power.

And "hope" isn't a power source.
