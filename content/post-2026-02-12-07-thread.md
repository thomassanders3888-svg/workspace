## MAIN POST (280 chars max)

We're racing to build AI that consumes more power than Argentina while shutting down nuclear plants.

This isn't climate policy. It's climate theater.

What happens when the AI revolution hits the blackout wall?

## THREAD: "The AI Power Paradox Nobody's Talking About"

1/12

The AI boom has an energy problem.

ChatGPT queries alone consume ~10x the energy of a Google search.
By 2030, AI data centers could use 4% of global electricity—more than most countries.

Meanwhile, we're decommissioning nuclear plants faster than we replace them.

This won't end well.

Here's the paradox: The same people who want AI to solve climate modeling, drug discovery, and grid optimization are the same ones blocking the only carbon-free baseload power source that can scale to meet it.

Nuclear isn't "part of the solution." For AI's energy demands, it's the ONLY solution.

Let's talk numbers.

A single ChatGPT-4 training run: ~50 GWh. That's what 40,000 US homes use in a year.

One Google search: 0.3 Wh.
One ChatGPT query: 2.9 Wh (and climbing with reasoning models).

Scale that to billions of users. Do the math. The grid creaks.

Enter the data center arms race.

Microsoft: $100B+ planned for AI data centers.
Amazon: $150B on new data center infrastructure.
Google: Requiring 24/7 carbon-free energy for operations by 2030.

Question: How do you get 24/7 carbon-free power without nuclear?

Spoiler: You don't.

"But wind and solar!"

I love renewables. I also understand physics.

The sun sets. The wind stops. Batteries scale linearly (expensive) while nuclear scales exponentially (cheap per MW).

AI data centers don't pause when clouds roll over. They need baseload. They need nuclear.

The irony? Most AI researchers I know are quietly worried about this.

They've built systems that could revolutionize medicine, design new materials, accelerate fusion research—then look up and realize there's not enough power to run them at scale.

Energy scarcity becomes an AI chokepoint.

Meanwhile, the policy disconnect is staggering.

Germany decommissioned its last 3 nuclear plants in 2023. Emissions went UP because they burned more coal.

California's Diablo Canyon was hours from closure before someone did the math on grid stability.

This isn't environmentalism. It's anti-progress masquerading as it.

Nuclear isn't perfect. We've made mistakes.

Three Mile Island taught us about training and protocols.
Fukushima taught us about siting and tsunamis.
Chernobyl taught us about Soviet design and authoritarian hubris.

We've learned. Modern designs are passively safe. We should build them.

The AI industry knows this.

Microsoft hired nuclear engineers to restart Three Mile Island.
Amazon bought a nuclear-powered data center campus.
Google invested in small modular reactors.

The people building the future aren't waiting for policy permission. They're just... betting on physics.

Here's what keeps me up at night as someone who taught naval nuclear operators and works with emerging tech:

If we don't solve the energy problem, AI becomes a luxury good for wealthy nations with stable grids.
The democratizing promise of AI—accessible intelligence for everyone—dies on a coal-powered vine.

The nuclear mindset I learned in the Navy applies here: You plan for worst-case scenarios.

If we build AI on a renewable-only grid and hit capacity limits, we face a choice:
- Throttle AI development (delay medical breakthroughs, climate solutions)
- Burn more fossil fuels (defeat the purpose)
- Scramble to build nuclear plants we should've built a decade ago

None of these are good.

So here's the ask: If you're building AI, lobbying for it, or regulating it—look at your energy assumptions.

"Net-zero by 2050" needs a credible path to 24/7 clean power.
"AI for everyone" needs the same.

Those paths converge at fission. Pretending otherwise is denial, not policy.

What comes first: AI's promise delivered, or the lights going out?
