Starlink can detect a hypersonic launch in 30 seconds. AI can recommend engagement in 10. But your commander still needs 30 minutes to approve because nobody taught him to trust the machine—or when to overrule it.

We're training brave officers for wars that move faster than their briefing slides.

Who's updating the curriculum?

## THREAD (12 posts)

**1/12**

I teach future naval officers at Newport. 

They're smart, motivated, technically literate. They can calculate reactor coolant flow rates and navigate by starlight.

But when I watch them wargame against AI opponents, I see something troubling:

They're waiting too long.

**2/12**

The AI "enemy" isn't always smarter. It's just faster.

While the human team debates which hunch is tactically sound, the algorithm has already:
- Re-routed three missile boats
- Spoofed comms frequencies  
- Calculated optimal kill chains

The human team is still on slide 3 of the brief.

**3/12**

This isn't about "autonomous weapons killing indiscriminately."

That's the cartoon version critics use. The real issue is subtler and more dangerous:

Humans and AI operating at radically different decision speeds—and nobody trained the humans to keep up.

**4/12**

Let me give you a real example from my classroom:

Scenario: Aegis radar detects multiple inbound tracks. Classification algorithm says 85% confidence "hostile." Human watchstander says "maybe."

8 minutes to impact. By doctrine, he needs OOD confirmation. OOD wants to consult with the tactical action officer.

The AI would have fired 4 minutes ago.

**5/12**

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

The algorithm wasn't wrong. The tracks WERE hostile. After the simulation ended, we played back the data—the AI's confidence estimate was calibrated better than the human observer's gut check.

But the human couldn't trust what he didn't understand.

**6/12**

This is the gap nobody talks about.

We spend billions on F-35s, hypersonics, drone swarms. We optimize for speed of platform, speed of missile, speed of data transmission.

But we haven't optimized for speed of HUMAN DECISION-MAKING in an AI-accelerated battlespace.

**7/12**

The Chinese PLA gets this. They're not hobbling themselves with philosophical debates about "meaningful human control."

They've built AI wargaming systems that let commanders practice against algorithmic opponents 10,000 times before a real conflict.

Practice creates fluency. Fluency creates speed.

**8/12**

We have some of this tech. The Navy's CONOPS development uses simulation. But there's a cultural barrier:

Admirals who cut their teeth in an analog age are designing doctrine for digital wars.

The result? Meaningful human control becomes "meaningful human veto"—which sounds principled until you realize the enemy AI doesn't wait for your philosophical commitment to be satisfied.

**9/12**

Let me be clear: The goal isn't autonomous kill chains. Nobody serious wants that.

The goal is TRAINED HUMAN JUDGMENT OPERATING AT MACHINE SPEED.

There's a difference between "human in the loop" and "human properly prepared to be in the loop."

Right now, we're doing the former without the latter.

**10/12**

What would fixing this look like?

1. **AI fluency as core curriculum**, not a PowerPoint guest lecture
2. **10,000 hours of human-vs-AI wargaming** before first sea tour
3. **Explainable AI interfaces** that show WHY the recommendation, not just WHAT
4. **Doctrine that codifies WHEN to defer to machine judgment**, not just IF

None of this exists at scale yet.

**11/12**

Think about the stakes.

If/when peer conflict happens with a technologically advanced adversary, the winner won't just have better missiles.

They'll have officers who can actually partner with AI—who know when to trust the algorithm's decision, when to question it, and how to decide in the time available.

The side that hesitates because doctrine is unclear will lose.

**12/12**

I teach at Officer Training Command. I see brilliant young officers ready to serve.

But I also see us sending them to sea with training designed for conflicts that moved at human cognition speed.

The next war won't wait for PowerPoint.

We're out of time to prepare them differently.
