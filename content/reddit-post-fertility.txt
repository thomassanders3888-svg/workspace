TITLE: The demographic math nobody's doing: 300M jobs exposed to AI automation + birth rates in freefall

BODY:

Everyone's talking about AI taking jobs OR the fertility crisis. Almost nobody's doing the combined analysis. Here's why that matters:

**The twin collision:**

South Korea: 0.72 births per woman
Taiwan: 0.86
Japan: 1.26
Italy: 1.24
US: 1.62 (record low)

Replacement rate: 2.1. We're not in maintenance mode. We are in collapse.

Meanwhile: Goldman Sachs estimates 300 million full-time jobs exposed to automation. McKinsey says half of all work could be automated by 2030.

**The uncomfortable equation:**

Civilization isn't funded by robots paying taxes.

Social Security, Medicare, infrastructure, defense — all require a ratio of workers to dependents.
- 1950: 16 workers per retiree
- Today: 3.3
- By 2030: 2.5

Add mass automation to this and what happens to the tax base?

**Two headlines, one decade:**

Scenario A: "AI abundance funds prosperous civilization with fewer workers"

Scenario B: "Automation perfected, civilization bankrupt, no one left to care"

The outcome depends on policy choices made in the next 5-10 years. We are not making them.

I wrote a longer thread on this with sources (Goldman, McKinsey, UN population data): [link when posted on X]

The question I keep coming back to: Can AI productivity create enough wealth to fund a smaller workforce before the tax base collapses? The optimist case requires redistribution mechanisms we haven't invented yet.

Curious about other takes on this. Is anyone factoring automation exposure into demographic/entitlement models?
