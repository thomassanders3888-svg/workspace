# Prompt Jobs - A Job Board Just for AI Roles

Hey r/PromptEngineering,

I've been job hunting for prompt engineering roles lately and honestly? It's been rough.

**The Problem**

Every job board I tried (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor) is flooded with generic AI-adjacent positions. I'll search "prompt engineer" and get 200 results where maybe 5 are actually what I'm looking for. The rest are "AI consultant" gigs, "ChatGPT content writer" roles, or sales positions slapped with AI buzzwords.

AI-specific roles just get buried under the noise.

**What I Built**

So I made **Prompt Jobs** - a job board dedicated *only* to AI roles. No fluff, no keyword spam, just actual positions for prompt engineers, ML engineers working with LLMs, AI product managers, and related roles.

**What Makes It Different**

- **Remote-first filter** - Most of us in this field work remotely anyway
- **Salary transparency** - Every posting shows the range upfront
- **10 hand-curated jobs** - I personally review each listing before it goes live
- **No AI-content-farm spam** - If it's not a real role, it doesn't make the cut

**Why only 10 jobs?**

Quality over quantity. I'd rather have 10 legit openings than 500 that waste everyone's time.

**I'd love your feedback**

This is a side project, and I want to build something actually useful for this community.

What features would make a job board *actually* worth your time? What's missing from the current options that frustrates you?

*TL;DR: Built a no-BS job board for AI/prompt engineering roles. Tired of wading through spammy listings. Would love your thoughts on what actually matters in a job board.*
