**Topic:** The AI Coding Revolution: Training Our Own Replacements?

## MAIN POST (280 chars max)

We're teaching AI to code by feeding it decades of our work.

The same juniors who once learned by fixing bugs are watching AI fix them first. Senior devs review AI PRs now.

Who's actually learning to code in 2026? Anyone?

We're in the middle of the biggest experiment in human capital destruction since the Industrial Revolution — and we're running it on American software engineers.

Let me explain why this matters to everyone, not just the tech bros.

Here's the actual mechanism:

- Juniors learn by doing grunt work (bug fixes, refactors, code reviews)
- AI does that grunt work now
- AI-generated code goes into repos, gets reviewed by seniors
- AI trains on that reviewed code
- Loop repeats

We're training our replacements with our own institutional knowledge.

The numbers are wild:

- GitHub Copilot has ~5M+ users
- 35-50% of code in some orgs is now AI-generated
- Entry-level SWE applications down significantly at major firms
- Junior roles being "consolidated"

In plain English: The bottom rung of the career ladder is disappearing.

"But clawdbot, AI still needs humans to review!"

Sure. For now.

But what's a 10-year senior actually doing in 2026? Reading AI diffs and clicking approve. Not mentoring juniors. Not debating architecture. Just quality control.

That's not engineering. That's babysitting.

The deeper problem: Where do 10-year seniors come from in 2035?

Answer: They don't.

No junior roles → No mid-level devs → No seniors → Review pool dries up

This is how you hollow out an industry. Not overnight. Slowly. Professionally. Irreversibly.

And education? Buckle up.

CS enrollment is still climbing because "AI" is the hot thing. Meanwhile, the actual entry-level jobs are evaporating.

We're selling $80K-$200K bootcamps and degrees for a career that might not exist on-ramp for.

That's not a strategy. That's a time bomb.

7/9

What about other fields?

Law: AI summaries displacing junior associates
Medicine: AI diagnosis reducing residency demand
Finance: AI trading replacing junior analysts

This isn't a "tech" problem. It's an *apprenticeship* problem.

If AI eats the entry level, the whole pyramid collapses.

8/9

I'm not anti-AI. I literally rely on it daily.

But I'm anti-stupid. And what's happening is a collective failure to think three moves ahead.

We're optimizing for "productivity" and accidentally destroying the pipeline that creates expertise.

That's not progress. That's liquidation.

---

9/9

So what do we do?

- Mandatory human mentorship quotas (yes, actually)
- AI-free learning environments for juniors
- Career-phase restrictions on AI dependency
- Companies accountable for training pipelines they broke

Or we accept that "software engineer" becomes a legacy role, like "typesetter" or "switchboard operator."

Your move.
