# Tired of Scattered Tasks and Lost Ideas?

You start the day with a clear plan. By 11 AM, it's buried under Slack messages, meeting notes, and random thoughts you swore you'd remember.

Your projects? Scattered across sticky notes, notebooks, and half-finished Google Docs.

Your great ideas? Gone. Vanished into the void of "I'll write that down later."

**You're not lazy. You just don't have a system.**
