AI is about to eat 4% of global electricity. We banned nuclear for decades and now we're surprised we're short on clean baseload power?

The AI revolution requires the atom. Full stop.

The AI energy crunch is real.

By 2026, data centers will consume more electricity than Japan's entire economy. Generative AI models are power-hungry beasts that make bitcoin mining look energy-efficient.

Clean energy advocates promised us wind and solar could handle everything.

Reality disagreed.

Here's the brutal math:

Training GPT-4 used ~50 GWh — enough to power 40,000 US homes for a week.

A single ChatGPT query now consumes 10x the energy of a Google search.

Scale that to billions of queries daily.

The renewables-only crowd did not account for this.

Data center capacity is constrained not by chips, but by grid interconnection.

Meta, Microsoft, Google, Amazon — all hitting the same wall: utilities can't get them power fast enough.

They're signing 10-20 year PPAs with utilities desperate to find generation.

And here's where it gets interesting.

The tech giants didn't want nuclear when it was cheap and available. Now they're begging for it.

Constellation Energy just closed $1B+ restart of Three Mile Island under a 20-year contract with Microsoft.

Let that sink in.

Three Mile Island. The site of America's worst nuclear accident (1979, zero casualties).

Now being restarted because AI needs reliable, carbon-free baseload. There's no irony here — just punishment for decades of energy illiteracy.

Nuclear was never unsafe. Policy was.

I spent years running naval reactors. The nuclear Navy hasn't had a reactor casualty since 1960.

60+ years of continuous operation under wartime conditions, harsh sounds, budget constraints.

If the tech works for submarines in combat, it works for your neighborhood.

**7/13**
SMRs (Small Modular Reactors) are the real unlock.

NuScale, 
















, Kairos, Oklo — building reactors that fit on a truck and power local grids.

And guess who's backing them? Bill Gates' TerraPower. Sam Altman's Oklo.

The VCs who built the software era are now betting on atoms.

The narrative flip happened fast.

2020: Nuclear is dead, Germany shuts down reactors.

2024-2025: People freeze in their homes paying €0.40/kWh while France runs steady at €0.15.

2026: The AI industry is nuclear's biggest champion.

Regulatory capture got outpaced by economic reality.

**9/13**
Let's be honest about who loses if we don't go nuclear.

Not the elites — they'll pay whatever for reliable power. It's the developing world that gets priced out of AI.

Want global inequality? Make AI compute a luxury good. Want democratized intelligence? Build 5¢/kWh everywhere.

**10/13**
The critics said:
"Nuclear waste is dangerous" — Meanwhile, 60 years of US waste fits in a warehouse.

"It takes 10 years to build" — Vogtle 3&4 took 14 years with design changes mid-build.

"Too expensive" — Works fine when we don't obstruct it with redundant regulations.

Japan built reactors in 4 years in the 1970s.

**11/13**
The AI-nuclear alliance will rewrite the map.

Entire states will become data center corridors. Former coal towns will host SMR clusters.

This is the biggest infrastructure shift since electrification itself.

And it's happening whether the greens like it or not.

**12/13**
So here's my ask:

If you spent the last decade mocking nuclear: what changed?

-when the same grid instability you dismissed hits AI training runs

-when tech companies vote with billions, not tweets

-when even environmentalists quietly admit we need baseload

The scoreboard has spoken. The atom won.

**13/13**
The nuclear renaissance isn't coming. It's here.

Only question now: Does America capture the value, or does China?

China builds 2-3 reactors per year. We debate permits.

The AI century runs on electricity. Let's not outsource the fuel.

Drop a 
if you see the future arriving.
