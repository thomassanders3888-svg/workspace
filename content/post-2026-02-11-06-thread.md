## MAIN POST (280 chars max)

The same tech bros who protested nuclear plants in 2010 are now begging for 100GW more power—for AI data centers.

Funny how ideology evaporates when your GPU cluster needs baseload.

Nuclear isn't "possible" anymore. It's *essential*.

When did you switch? #NuclearEnergy #AI #EnergyCrisis #DataCenters

1/12

Five years ago, nuclear was "too dangerous" and "economically unviable."

Today, Amazon just bought a nuclear-powered data center. Microsoft is reopening Three Mile Island. Sam Altman is betting billions on fusion.

What changed? Scale met reality.

2/12

AI training runs don't care about your renewable energy schedule.

When ChatGPT answers a question, it's not pulling from solar-kWh nostalgia. It needs 24/7 consistent megawatts.

Intermittent power can't scale AI. Period.

3/12

A single 100B parameter model can burn through enough electricity to power 100 homes for a year—*just in training.*

Now multiply by every startup, every enterprise deployment, every multimodal system coming online.

We're not talking about "clean" energy.

4/12

We're talking about *density*.

A nuclear plant packs gigawatts into a footprint smaller than a shopping mall. Try achieving that with solar farms. You'd clear-cut states.

The environmental "solution" was always part of the problem.

5/12

China understands this. They're building 27 new reactors right now.

Russia's exporting floating nuclear plants to the developing world.

Meanwhile, Western regulators spent 20 years adding compliance costs until new plants became impossible.

We've been playing ourselves.

6/12

The irony? Nuclear is the safest energy source by deaths-per-TWh.

Safer than solar (installers fall off roofs). Safer than wind (technicians die servicing turbines). Safer than *walking*.

Your irrational fear of meltdowns is statistically—and energetically—expensive.

7/12

SMRs (Small Modular Reactors) are the real game-changer.

Factory-built. Transportable. Scalable.

Instead of decade-long construction projects, drop a reactor where the data center needs it.

Nuclear finally learned how to ship product.

8/12

But here's what critics miss: this isn't about electricity generation anymore.

It's about *compute* generation.

Energy is now the primary constraint on AI progress. The countries that solve energy abundance will own the 21st century.

9/12

The US Navy has safely operated nuclear reactors on ships for 70+ years.

Hundreds of reactors. Thousands of sailors. Zero meltdowns.

The technology works. The discipline exists.

What's missing? Regulatory courage and public literacy.

10/12

I'm not waiting for politicians to figure this out.

I'm building. Teaching. Deploying.

The next generation of nuclear engineers and the data centers they power will determine whether Western AI stays competitive.

Energy policy *is* national security policy.

11/12

The population decline numbers are real. The energy transition challenges are real. The AI race is real.

Nuclear isn't a silver bullet—it's the only bullet we have that works at the scale civilization requires.

Time to get serious about abundance.

12/12

If you're building in AI, energy, or nuclear: let's talk.

The next decade isn't hypothetical. It arrives one megawatt at a time.

What's your take—will regulatory inertia kill Western nuclear before SMRs can save it?
