We're building superintelligence while our smartest people stop having kids.

AI gets exponentially smarter. The human capital to steer it? Flatlining.

Most people haven't connected these dots. Let me show you why this might be the most dangerous blind spot in tech. 🧵

The numbers are stark:

• Stanford AI PhD graduates: ~100/year (flat for a decade)
• Leading AI labs collectively hire maybe 1,000 top researchers globally
• Meanwhile, AI capability doubles every 6-10 months

We're asking a shrinking elite to chart the course for machines that will reshape civilization.

Meanwhile, the talent pipeline is cracking.

Elite universities saw 5-15% enrollment drops in CS/ML programs 2022-2024. Not because interest faded—because standards got politicized, visas tightened, and the best minds started opting out of the ivory tower circus.

We're filtering for compliance, not brilliance.

Here's the fertility piece nobody talks about:

Female PhDs have 0.7-1.2 children on average. At replacement rate of 2.1, that's half the next generation of researchers never born.

Over 30 years of this? You're not just short on coders. You're missing the professors, mentors, and visionaries who would have trained them.

This compounds.

When a field requires 10 years of apprenticeship (PhD + postdoc + lab experience), you can't just "hire more."

The person who mentors the breakthrough researcher? They needed to be born 40 years ago and choose academia over the hedge fund or startup.

That decision tree is drying up.

I'm Navy nuclear trained. I know what happens when you lose expertise.

During the last nuclear renaissance push (2005-2010), we realized half the experienced reactor operators were retiring—with barely anyone to replace them. You can't fast-track nuclear competence. It takes decades.

AI alignment might be the same.

The uncomfortable question:

Can a *shrinking* population of human researchers meaningfully supervise a *growing* population of AI capabilities?

At some point, you're not managing the technology. You're just riding it.

Every month the gap widens. Every month we're less prepared.

The "just scale compute" crowd misses this.

GPT-5 runs on billions in chips, sure. But who decides the values encoded in it? Who audits the emergent behaviors? Who catches the edge cases?

The answer: increasingly, fewer and fewer people. With less institutional memory. And less time to think.

There's a dark joke in here:

The people most worried about AI alignment—intellectuals, researchers, futurists—are the *same demographic* with the lowest fertility.

We're literally selecting against the very humans who think critically about long-term consequences.

Natural selection doesn't care about your concerns.

What would solving this look like?

• Serious fertility incentives for elite researchers (not handouts; recognition)
• Alternative credentialing systems (hiring for competence over paper)
• Remote-first global talent markets (if domestic pipelines clog, go global)
• Apprenticeship models that compress the timeline

None of this is happening fast enough.

I teach future officers. Here's what I see:

The freshman class of 2026 is sharp, no doubt. But there's *fewer* of them. And half the senior instructors who could have mentored them? Gone early—retired, burned out, or silenced by administrative bloat.

The transfer of knowledge requires humans. In sufficient numbers. We're thinning both ends.

---

The timeline:

• 2027: AI systems exceed human expertise in specialized domains
• 2030: First AI designs that no human fully understands
• 2035: Population bulge of experienced researchers fully retired

The gap between capability and comprehension widens exactly when we should be narrowing it.

That's not inevitable. But it *is* the current trajectory.

**What do you think?** 

Can better tools compensate for fewer minds? Or is this civilization's silent bottleneck?
