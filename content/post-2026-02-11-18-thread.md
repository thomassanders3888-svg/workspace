South Korea just hit 0.72 births per woman. Japan's been declining since 1974. The US fertility rate just hit 1.62—lowest in history. We've built AI that can write poetry, but nobody can build a culture where people want kids.  #DemographicWinter #PopulationCollapse #FutureOfHumanity

In 1950, the average woman had 5 children. In 2025, it's 2.3 globally—and falling fast. South Korea at 0.72. Spain at 1.2. China at 1.0. This isn't a trend. It's a civilizational pivot point. And we're treating it like a footnote.

"Just import workers!" Okay. Germany tried that. Result? Integration challenges, political backlash, and native fertility still collapsing. Importing people doesn't fix why your own population stopped replacing itself. It just delays the math problem.

Here's what nobody talks about: the fertility rate needed just to *maintain* population is 2.1. The US (1.62), Italy (1.24), Japan (1.26), South Korea (0.72). These aren't small deviations. These are extinction-level gradients without the asteroid.

Why are people having fewer kids? The list got opinionated:
- Housing costs + student debt = delayed everything
- Career/craft optimized for two incomes requires two incomes
- Social status increasingly detached from parenthood
- Technology replaced kids as meaning-source
- Pessimism about the future (ironic, given we're richest ever)

The "silver lining" arguments are getting desperate:
- "Fewer people = less climate impact!" (Cool. Also less innovation, less GDP, unfunded pensions)
- "Robots will work!" (Yes. Also consume nothing, pay no taxes, fund no retirements)
- "Quality over quantity!" (Sure. But quantity matters when you're 65 with no caregiver)

What shrinking populations actually look like: empty schools converted to senior centers. Rural towns vanishing. Young people crushed by dependency ratios (more retirees, fewer workers). Governments choosing between inflation (print money) or default (cut benefits). Japan's been the canary for 30 years.

Want to see something wild? Look at South Korea. $100K+ subsidies per child. Cheapest childcare in the OECD. Highest education spending. 0.72 fertility. Money isn't the constraint. Culture is. When your society treats childbearing as inconvenience, no tax credit fixes that.

Every civilization that stopped replacing itself has something in common: they got rich, complacent, and individualistic first. Rome's fertility collapsed before the legions did. The difference? We have data. We *know* what's happening. And we're still choosing short-term comfort over long-term survival.

So what actually works?
- **Cultural**: Restore status/meaning to parenthood (not just "acceptable lifestyle choice")
- **Economic**: Make housing affordable, enable single-income families again
- **Policy**: Subsidize childcare, not just punish childlessness
- **Technology**: Fertility tech, extended reproduction windows, cultural tech that makes family attractive

Unpopular? Yes. Necessary? Also yes.

Here's the real question you should be asking: If we can pour $500B into AI models and殖民 Mars plans, why is raising the next generation treated as a personal inconvenience instead of our most important collective project?

Because the math eventually wins. It always does.
