## MAIN POST (284 chars)

Everyone's worried AI will steal jobs.

Nobody's talking about AI stealing our *electricity*.

A single ChatGPT query ≈ 10x the energy of a Google search.
Data centers already eat 3% of global power.

The real constraint on AI isn't compute—it's kilowatts.

What's the plan when the grid breaks?

Everyone's worried AI will steal their job.

Nobody's worried AI will steal their *electricity*.

Time for a thread on the power paradox nobody's discussing.

A single ChatGPT query uses ~10x the energy of a Google search.

AI training? One model can consume as much power as 100 homes for a year.

We're building brain-scale computation on a grid designed for toasters and light bulbs.

Data centers already consume 3% of global electricity.

By 2030, some estimates say it'll hit 8%.

The US is reopening coal plants to keep up with demand.

Coal. In 2026.

We're solving intelligence and forgetting physics.

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

The constraint on AI progress isn't chips or talent anymore.

It's baseload power.

You can't just "turn up" a wind farm when 50 million GPUs hit midnight training runs.

Enter nuclear. Specifically: SMRs (Small Modular Reactors).

Portable. Factory-built. Deployable to your data center campus.

Microsoft just struck a deal to power AI development with Three Mile Island's successor.

The future is nuclear-powered AI.

I've seen this before.

The Navy's been running small reactors for decades—quietly, safely, reliably.

We learned how to make enrichment and fleet deployment work as a *system*.

The civilian world is about to relearn these lessons the hard way.

But here's what keeps me up at night:

We're not training the engineers who'll build this stuff.

Nuclear programs are aging out.

The same industry that powered the 20th century is losing its knowledge base.

Right when we need it most.

The irony is brutal:

AI might automate coding, writing, and design...
but it can't automate the 80,000 hours of experience needed to certify a reactor operator.

Some human capital is irreplaceable—if we let it walk out the door.

This isn't just about keeping the lights on.

It's about which nations *have* lights in 2040.

Energy = compute. Compute = AI dominance. AI dominance = economic security.

The countries that solve clean baseload power own the century.

So what's the play?

Half-measures won't cut it. You can't "solar panel" your way to AGI.

We need a three-pronged approach:
- Massive nuclear buildout (SMRs + large-scale)
- AI efficiency research (optimize the models themselves)
- Human capital pipeline (train the operators)

There's a version of the future where AI helps us solve fusion, optimize grids, and build a post-scarcity economy.

And there's a future where we burn coal until the blackouts roll, wondering why the bots went dark.

Same tech. Different choices.

Next time someone warns you about AI taking jobs, ask them:

"What powers the AI?"

Because if the answer is "coal and dreams," we're not having the right conversation.

The future belongs to the nations that can *build*—not just code.
