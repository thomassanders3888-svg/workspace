We've built an education system requiring infinite cheap labor to watch 30 kids take turns reading aloud. Now we don't have the people. Do the math: either AI tutors every kid to mastery, or you start combining classrooms. Neither future looks much like a classroom.

Back-of-the-envelope: the US will need ~200,000 more K-12 teachers next decade than it's on pace to produce. Meanwhile, the Navy nuclear pipeline—a system I've lived in for years—trains people to operate a nuclear reactor in half that time. Something is deeply broken.

The conventional explanation: "people don't want to teach." Wrong framing. Far fewer people want to *operate* the anomaly detection logic validation for a boiling water reactor in a submarine, and yet that pipeline fills because the structure rewards the position properly.

3/11
Teachers don't leave because the work is hard. They leave because the structure treats them as interchangeable babysitting labor despite requiring a degree, certification, and ongoing credentialing. The human capital is locked in a system that deliberately wastes it.

4/11
You can see this in the substitute epidemic. Some districts are effectively operating with rotating temps because the job was designed for 1950s labor markets: one income family, job security, summers off. That world ended, but the job architecture stayed frozen.

5/11
The population decline people keep screaming about? It's a double hit. Fewer babies = fewer students, which eventually means fewer teaching positions, which makes *today's* shortage worse because anyone smart runs the numbers and realizes the field is shrinking.

6/11
Here's where it gets nukular. The current bet is AI tutors make the math work again: one human manages assessments, AI delivers personalized instruction, class sizes balloon or collapse entirely. This is simultaneously hopeful and terrifying, and nobody's talking about the real problem.

7/11
Learning is a social process. Full stop. A kid staring at a tablet doing personalized math drills is improved* instruction but degraded* education if it severs the human connection. Not everything scales. Friendship doesn't scale. Curiosity benefits from friction and witness.

8/11
The LINE—the actual thing we need to solve—isn't "how do we replace teachers with software?" It's "how do we restructure learning so that humans do what humans do brilliantly and technology amplifies it?"

9/11
We figured this out in nuclear power a generation ago. Watch officers don't run unit physics calculations by hand. The reactor plant is instrumented, simulated, validated by machine. But when the alarm sounds, you want a trained human making decisions under uncertainty with judgment.

10/11
The education system needs the same philosophy. AI handles the pacing, the personalization, the feedback loops. But you still need humans building trust, spotting the kid who's disengaging, asking "why do you think that?" and holding space for the learner to struggle.

11/11
Stop worrying about "teacher shortages" like it's a staffing problem. It's a design problem. The current architecture needs more bodies than exist. Either we rebuild it around technology and rare human talent, or we watch the whole thing collapse. No third option. Which future do you want?
