We built the atom bomb from scratch in 3 years. 

We went from Sputnik to walking on the moon in 12.

Now it takes 8 years and $2B to build a subway station.

What broke? 

We didn't forget physics. We obeyed committees.

We built the world's first nuclear weapon from an empty desert to a working device in less than 3 years.

The Manhattan Project: 130,000 people. 30+ facilities. True theoretical breakthroughs.

Not a hypothetical. Not a roadmap. Deliberate, coordinated, dangerous—and *done*.

Apollo followed: Kennedy's speech in 1961. Boot prints in 1969.

No one had done it before. We were inventing orbital mechanics, heat shields, cryogenic fuel systems as fast as we needed them.

Total NASA budget peak: 4.4% of federal spending.

We bought a moon with 4.4%.

Compare today.

The Second Avenue Subway in Manhattan: first proposed 1929. First phase opened 2017. Cost: $4.45 billion per mile.

That's almost 5x the cost of comparable European subway construction.

Same concrete. Same steel. Different country.

Why?

Not corruption. Not laziness. Not "we forgot how."

We chose process over product.

The Manhattan Project had one approval chain: Groves → Stimson → Truman.

Today, a major infrastructure project crosses:
- Federal agencies
- State agencies
- Municipal boards
- Environmental review
- Historical preservation
- Community input (× dozens)
- Litigation (× hundreds)

Each one reasonable. Each one democratic. Each one adds months.

Together? They create an immune system against building anything.

The system isn't designed to say "yes." It's designed to say "not yet"—forever.

"Consultation" as indefinite delay.

I write this as someone who's watched.

Naval nuclear power: from first prototype (1954) to fleet-wide deployment in ~15 years.

Because the Navy said "yes" and let engineers engineer.

No public comment period on reactor physics. No community board vote on thermodynamic efficiency.

Competence, authorized.

SpaceX recaptures some of this. Not because Elon is magic. Because they iterate faster than bureaucracies can meet.

They build, blow up, build again. Each failure is data. Each success is permission to go faster.

The federal government can't legally operate that way. Which is why we're watching private companies outpace NASA.

Here's the uncomfortable question:

If the Manhattan Project ran on 2025 rules, would we have gotten the bomb before Berlin fell?

Einstein's letter to Roosevelt was 1939. First test: 1945. Six years, emergency pace.

Imagine that timeline with modern environmental review. With mandatory community engagement. With lawsuits from "Citizens Against Fast Neutrons."

This isn't nostalgia. It's diagnosis.

We didn't lose the ability to build.

We lost the willingness to let anyone *try* without permission from everyone.

Democracy is good. Distributed accountability is good. But infinite veto points kill action.

And action is the prerequisite for everything else.

AI might break the logjam.

Not because it's smarter, but because it accelerates iteration cheaply.

Can't afford 8 years of review? What if you compress R&D from months to minutes?

What if simulation replaces committee?

The nations that build fast will inherit the ones that debate.

But AI alone won't fix it.

The fundamental constraint isn't technical. It's legal, regulatory, cultural.

We can generate designs instantly. We still can't dig a subway without 47 permits.

The bottleneck moved from "can we solve this" to "are we allowed to try."

So here's my question:

We're told AI will transform everything. But transformation requires *building*.

And we've made building the most difficult thing in America.

If we want the next Manhattan Project—the next Apollo—the next nuclear fleet—we don't need smarter AI.

We need permission to move.

Who do we fire?
