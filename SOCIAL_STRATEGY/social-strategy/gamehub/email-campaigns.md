## Email Sequence 1: Welcome Series

### Email 1: Welcome (Immediate)

**Subject:** 🎮 Welcome to the arcade [First Name]

```
Hi [First Name],

You just unlocked 1000+ free arcade games.

No catch. No credit card. No "premium" upsells.

Just pure, unfiltered gaming.

👉 PLAY NOW: [LINK]

But before you dive in (and lose 3 hours like I did
testing Cyber Defense last night)...

Here's your cheat sheet:

🕹️ START HERE (if you're new):
→ Neon Rush - Racing meets synthwave perfection
→ Pixel Platformer - Nintendo vibes, zero nostalgia tax
→ Card Crawler - MtG meets roguelike

🕹️ HIDDEN GEMS (no one talks about):
→ Gravity Flip - Simple concept, addictive AF
→ Dungeon Dots - Connect-3 meets RPG

What are you waiting for?

P.S. - Chief Gamer signing off (that's me)

P.P.S. - Hit reply, tell me what you want to see. I read every email.

### Email 2: Value - Pro Tips (Day 2)

**Subject:** The games that break our servers (play these)

```
Hi [First Name],

Quick story:

Last Tuesday, our little "gravity-based puzzle game" 
sent us a "server overload" alert.

Why?

Someone played it for 8 hours straight. 
And they weren't even close to done.

(I see you, Tyler from Ohio 👀)

So here are the 3 games that consistently 
KILL productivity:

🎮 GRAVITY FLIP
Simple: Shift gravity to navigate levels.
Reality: "Just one more level" until 2am.
→ [Play It]

🎮 NEON RUSH  
Simple: Race through synth tunnels.
Reality: You WILL try to beat your time 47 times.
→ [Play It]

🎮 DUNGEON DOTS
Simple: Match colors, fight monsters.
Reality: "Why am I still awake? Oh right, level 89."
→ [Play It]

You've been warned.

[CTA: Browse All Games]

P.S. - Got a high score? Reply with a screenshot!
I feature players in our weekly newsletter.

### Email 3: Value - Hidden Features (Day 4)

**Subject:** 5 things you didn't know GameHub could do

```
Hi [First Name],

Confession time:

We built some features that even I forget about.

Here are the 5 "wait, it does THAT?" features:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
Space = pause
R = restart
M = mute
Ctrl+D = bookmarks game

2️⃣ SAVE YOUR PROGRESS
Most games auto-save. 
Close your tab, comeback later.

3️⃣ LEADERBOARD FILTERS
"I want to see only my friends"
Tech: Coming in 2 weeks

4️⃣ MOBILE MODE
Landscape your phone. 
Instant console vibes.

5️⃣ DARK MODE
Click the 🌙 icon.
Better for late-night sessions.
(We know what you're doing at 2am)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Pro tip: Bookmark your favorites.
Your future self will thank you.

[CTA: Explore Features]

P.S. - What's your #1 feature request? 
Seriously, I want to know.
```

### Email 4: Soft Pitch - Community (Day 7)

**Subject:** Join the secret level

```
Hi [First Name],

You've been playing for a week.

(Our analytics told me. Not creepy, just... attentive.)

So here's the thing most players don't know:

We're building GameHub as a community, not just a site.

That means:

✅ You vote on next games
✅ You beta test new features  
✅ You get early access
✅ You shape what we build

The secret level? Our Discord.

[CTA: Join Discord]

Current active discussions:
→ "What game genre are we missing?"
→ "Show your high scores" thread
→ "Bug reports & feature requests"
→ Gaming news + memes (of course)

Plus I hang out there daily.

Come say hi 👋

[CTA: Join The Community]

P.S. - Discord users get early access to our 
biggest feature launch ever. Hint: it rhymes 
with "tournament mode."
```

## Email Sequence 2: Re-engagement (Inactive 30 days)

### Email 1: We miss you

**Subject:** [First Name], was it something we said?

```
Hi [First Name],

No emails from me lately.

Why? Because you haven't visited GameHub in a while.

And I respect your inbox too much to spam you 
with "just checking in" nonsense.

But here's what you missed:

🎮 23 new games added
🏆 New leaderboard system
🕹️ Game of the Month: Cyber Defense 2

Want back in?

[CTA: See What's New]
