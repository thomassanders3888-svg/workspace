## Trader Status
**PAUSED as of 8:15 PM** - Running simulation only, not real trades
- Issue: API falls back to historical 2020 markets when rate limited
- Result: ~70+ "trades" logged on expired events (Trump inauguration, ETH 2.0, etc.)
- **$30 USDC untouched** in wallet - zero real trades executed
- Fix needed: Real Polymarket API connection + order execution

## Commits
