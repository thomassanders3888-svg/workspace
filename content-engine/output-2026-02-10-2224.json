Zero excuses.\n\nYet civilian SMRs face 10+ years of NRC paper-pushing for designs wealready know work.\n\nThe nuclear navy proved safety through engineering. The NRC demands safety through documentation.\n\nWhich method kept sailors alive?\n\n#NuclearEnergy #SMRs #MoltenSalt #EnergyPolicy",

We operated reactors with 95%+ uptime, surrounded by ocean, in combat conditions, with 20-year-old sailors at the controls.\n\nNot a single meltdown in 70+ years. Not one.\n\nSo why does a land-based SMR need a decade of regulatory review?"
